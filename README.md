A full-stack bug tracker application built on my free time to learn and make use of recent JavaScript frameworks and libraries. It utilizes Mongo database and Express.js for backend and React.js + Redux for front end. Everything was compiled using Webpack and the source code is ES6 JavaScript transpiled with Babel.

This is a Create, Read, Update, Delete application (C.R.U.D)

1. To add a new bug to the bugs database: [Add A New Bug](http://danielristic.ca/projects/bugtracker)
 - this will take you to the view bugs page upon completion.

2. To view bugs and sort by status and priority: [View And Sort Bugs](http://danielristic.ca/projects/bugtracker/viewbugs) *there is also a link to the homepage where you can add a new bug.

3. To update or delete a bug, simply click on the edit pencil icon and it will take you to the edit bugs page. [Update Or Delete A Bug](http://danielristic.ca/projects/bugtracker/editbugs). *note this page can not be accessed directly without first selecting a bug.

Please feel free to try it out and see the power of React and Redux! :)
