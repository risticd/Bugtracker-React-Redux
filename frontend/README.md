## Project Info

### Generate Task

All new components/pages that don't yet exist should be generated using the `gulp generate` task. Please do not copy/paste other components. The generate task should be used and will ultimately be faster and less error prone to use than manual file creation.

### Routing

The React router library is used for page routing. Please refer to the documentation on the react router page for more information.

### Material UI

The project uses the material-ui library as a base for many of the components required by the creative designs. Please refer to the material-ui documentation before getting started on this project.

## Getting Started

To setup your development environment, simply run `npm install` from the project root directory.

## Dev Server

The project currently uses webpack to serv the front-end. To start the server, run `npm start` once you've installed the project dependencies with `npm install`.
